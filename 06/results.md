I was 'wrong' :shrug:

# Why

The file name, and thus the package name, for the teaser overwrites the built in package path. The result is `ModuleNotFoundError`.

# What else I learned

Why I hate these types of "teasers". This is useful to know, but I don't find that it advances my knowledge of python. It is more like a gotcha, something to avoid, : and less a teaser, a problem to solve.
